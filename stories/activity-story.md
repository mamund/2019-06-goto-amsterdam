Each company or company/account pair has one or more associated activity records. These records list the ways (and reasons) BigCo staff will be contacting the company on various matters. It acts as both a contact scheduler and log. Current activity type values are `email`, `inperson`, `phone`, and `letter`. Other types might be added in the future.

Each activity record has the activity type, `company identifier, account identifier, date/time scheduled, and notes properties. There is also a status value (`suspended`, `active`, `pending`, `closed`). We also track the date/time the record was created and the date/time it was last updated.
